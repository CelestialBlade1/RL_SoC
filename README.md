## Hello! Let's embark on a journey through Reinforcement Learning!

This repository reflects the checkpoints of the 2023 instance of SoC: Street Fighter II - Reinforcement Learning. Consider cloning this repo and pulling it time and again. (Huh? What does this mean? To know more, see Week_0)

I have taken ideas from Prof. Shivaram's course - CS747: Foundations of Intelligent and Learning Agents - offered at IIT Bombay.

### Overview
With python as our baseline for all code (which I will glibly assume you are familiar with) we are set to begin our journey through Reinforcement Learning. This SoC instance will be distributed into a 7 week paradigm of assignments, review meets and lots of fun!

I will also assume that you are using a Windows 11 OS machine (if not, let me know). I recommend a machine with at least 4GB RAM and i5 equivalent core or better (model training is tedious for the computer).

### Logistics
1. Each week, material will be uploaded in a folder named with the week number. Weekly, you are required to do four things: 
    * View the theory resources, ask questions.
    * View the coding task (based on the week's theory) and ask lots of questions. Setup info will be given for libraries/software. Code away to glory!
    * Solve the theory assignment. You might find some of the problems difficult. From a practical point of view, the theory assignment will cover problems which you will face before writing code, like modeling. This is extremely important, because as you will soon discover, more than 80% of machine learning is just humans learning more about their own cognitive capabilites!
    * Watch the tutorial video. If the coding or theory assignment has challenging elements, I will solve a similar problem and upload it as a tutorial video.
2. On weekends, there will be an online review meet. The agenda of every meet will always include doubts, and reviewing what you have learnt in the week.
3. The deadlines for the tasks will generally be a week from the date of announcement. I will also specify the deadline along with the problem statement.
4. The main project work on Street Fighter II ROM will take two full weeks, towards the end of the 8-week paradigm when you all will be enjoying your vacations :)
